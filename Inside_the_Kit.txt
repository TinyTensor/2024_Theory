Components in an Arduino TinyML BLE 33 Kit:
- ARDUINO Nano 33 BLE Sense Lite
- TinyML Shield
- OV7675 Camera Module
- USB A - Micro USB Cable (1 meter)

In the TinyML Shield, there are 6 groups of ports, 3 on the right mainly serve for most sensors, the other 3 on the left serve for special sensors or different ML tools.

For ARDUINO Nano 33 BLE Sense Lite, it consists of some sensors:
- Bluetooth
- NFC Wifi
- IMU (9 axis, consists accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer)
- Humidity
- Temperature
- Barometric (pressure)
- Microphone
- Colour (detect RGB)
